# Introduction

Welcome to the Instamelb API! This is a shameless copy of Instagram with a twist.

Language bindings in Shell and Java. Java docs incomplete at this point in time. Refer to shell tab for curl syntax.
Code examples are viewable in thee dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

All responses are in JSON.

Pagination is a stretch goal. Is not specified at this moment.
